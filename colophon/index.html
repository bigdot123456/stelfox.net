      <h1>Colophon</h1>

<p>While I was building this site I had a few requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>It needed to be fast and easy to host</li>
<li>I needed to be able to update significant portions using only the command
line</li>
<li>I should learn something while creating it</li>
<li>The style should be fairly simple</li>
<li>I want to use Ruby to build it (my current programming language of choice)</li>
<li>I want the content to be created using <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">GitHub style markdown</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There were many roads that I could down but ultimately decided that I’d follow
the growing trend of people that were building “flat-file” websites. This route
would make the site incredibly easy to host and as fast as you can get.</p>

<h2>The Engine</h2>

<p>There are several solid flat-file site generators written in Ruby including
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> (Which is technically Jekyll behind the scenes
as well), however, those projects seem to have a few outstanding bugs, are
beginning to go stale, have some strange quirks and the maintainers of Jekyll
at least seem to be slow in accepting pull requests.</p>

<p>I took a stab at building my own, which was a never released bit of code I
named <em>StrangeCase</em>. It worked well and it generated my last site for over a
year. I moved away from it to <a href="http://nanoc.ws/">Nanoc</a> as it was more flexible than my
system, it just took me a while to get it customized to have feature parity
with mine and be able to handle all of my content.</p>
