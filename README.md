# Stelfox Athen&#xe6;um

This is the source code of [Sam Stelfox's personal site][1].

I make use of [Nanoc][2] for the generation of it as well as custom helpers and
filter.

Don't judge me too harshly on this code; This was initially a prototype so I
regularily took some shortcuts. Making my site public will encourage me to
increase the quality of the code behind my site just like it did for open
sourcing my notes as my [knowledge base][3].
