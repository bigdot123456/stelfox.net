Better caching headers on content. Recommended files and cache time (not sure how I could handle the analytics one...):

https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js (2 hours)
https://stelfox.net/assets/css/main.77da63e1.css (5 days)
https://stelfox.net/assets/js/main.f29c93b9.js (5 days)

Blocking CSS resources:

https://fonts.googleapis.com/â€¦?family=Ubuntu:400,400i,700&subset=latin
https://stelfox.net/assets/css/main.77da63e1.css

My pages are quite small but they could be smaller. I likely don't need all my
CSS and JS...
