Apparently I need to redo how google analytics is setup on my page...

https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js (2 hours)

Blocking CSS resources:

https://fonts.googleapis.com/â€¦?family=Ubuntu:400,400i,700&subset=latin
https://stelfox.net/assets/css/main.77da63e1.css

My pages are quite small but they could be smaller. I likely don't need all my
CSS and JS...

Review RSS content, it likely is including my notes in addition to my blog
posts...
