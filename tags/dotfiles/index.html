      <h2><a href="/blog/2013/11/using-vim-as-your-password-manager/">Using VIM as Your Password Manager</a></h1>
      <aside>Posted at: 2013-11-25 15:10:46 -0500</aside>
      <article>
        <p>There are all kinds of password managers out there. Everything from <a href="https://www.passpack.com/en/home/">web
services</a> that are quite solid and respectible, to <a href="https://lastpass.com/">native</a> <a href="http://keepass.info/">desktop</a>
apps.</p>

<p>A lot of these are simply too heavy for me, involve installing software on a
computer to access in addition to sharing the file around, or required you to
remember multiple account details before you could get access to any individual
password.</p>

<p>Due too the various complexities and lack of matching use cases a couple years
ago I set out to develop my own open-source version of <a href="https://www.passpack.com/en/home/">Passpack</a>. In the
interim though I needed a solution for keeping track of my hundreds of various
accounts and their passwords.</p>

<p>Around this time I was ramping up my usage of vim and happened to come across a
very fortunate command entirely by accident. Enter <em>vimcrypt</em>.</p>

<p>For any plaintext file you, while in command mode you can type the command <code>:X</code>
and it will ask you for a password to encrypt your file with. By default this
uses a remarkably weak algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKZIP">pkzip</a> which isn&#39;t secure enough
for me to trust it with my keys.</p>

<p>Since vim 7.3 and later, <code>:X</code> has also supported an additional cipher; The much
stronger blowfish algorithm. You can enable this by running the command <code>:set
cryptmethod=blowfish</code>. I chose to add the following lines to my <code>~/.vimrc</code>
file:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>&quot; When encrypting any file, use the much stronger blowfish algorithm
set cryptmethod=blowfish
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>This was a fantastic interim solution as I have yet to find a development or
production linux system that hasn&#39;t been excessively locked down (and probably
not somewhere I&#39;d put my password file anyway) that didn&#39;t already have vim
installed.</p>

<p>Using this personally required me coming up with a pseudo-file format that
would allow me to quickly and easily find the credentials I needed. I settled
on the simple format shown off below:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>Oneline Account Description
  Site: &lt;URL of Site's login page&gt;
  Username: &lt;username for the site&gt;
  Password: &lt;password for the site&gt;
  Email: &lt;email I used to register&gt;

  Login with: &lt;email|username&gt; # Only necessary when I have both

  ** Address on file **
  ** Phone on file **
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>You&#39;ll notice I also used this to keep track of whether an account had physical
information tied to it. When I moved this made it very quick for me to search
for accounts that I needed to update with my new mailing address.</p>

<p>As with many solutions this &quot;temporary&quot; one became more and more permanent as
my motivation to build the Passpack competitor dwindled. My problem had been
solved and I was no longer compelled to put any effort into a solution.</p>

<p>If this still isn&#39;t strong enough for your tastes, the <a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Encryption">vim wiki</a> has some
additional ways you can encrypt your files. These all require additional setup
and failed my requirements in that they generally require additional files or
setup before I can access my passwords.</p>

<p>Hope this helps some other weary CLI warrior some trouble. Cheers!</p>

<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: I received a wonderful recommendation from a user named
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1rg3ji/wrote_up_my_thoughts_on_using_vim_as_a_password/cdn20o8">sigzero</a> over on Reddit. For additional security they added the following
line to their <code>~/.vimrc</code> file.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>autocmd BufReadPost * if &amp;key != &quot;&quot; | set noswapfile nowritebackup viminfo= nobackup noshelltemp history=0 secure | endif
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>It disables additional files that vim may write copies to such as swap files
and backups, prevents dangerous shell commands, and prevents vim from storing a
history of commands.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update 2</em></strong>: I received another fantastic recommendation from another reddit
user, this time from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1rg3ji/wrote_up_my_thoughts_on_using_vim_as_a_password/cdnn94z">NinlyOne</a>. At their recommendation, I&#39;ve prepended the
following modeline to my password. It automatically folds each password entry
to prevent potential shoulder surfing. You can open up an entry using the
command <code>zo</code> and close it back up with <code>zc</code>. It&#39;s worth noting that this is
tied to my indented file format.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre># vim: fdm=indent fdn=1 sw=2:
