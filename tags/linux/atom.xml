      <description>I keep a copy of my mutt config both here on the site as well as in my public dotfiles. Eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll likely document my reasoning, preferences and the tradeoffs made in that config (and change my mind on most in the process).
Vim Since I use vim as my editor I also added the following line to my vim configuration file to autowrap my lines at 72 characters, but only for mutt composed messsages.</description>

      <description>iptables (and ip6tables) is a simple application for interacting directly with the Linux kernel&amp;rsquo;s netfilter firewall. nftables is attempting to replace it. nftables has better performance but is incredibly complex and difficult to use. Until the tooling and usability around nftables is addressed iptables will likely remain the reigning champion.
It is important that your systems have effective ingress and egress rules. Depending on your host OS, you&amp;rsquo;ll find your rule set stored in different locations but the following list are where I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them before:</description>

      <title>Syslog-NG</title>

      <description>Syslog-NG is a fast, reliable, and secure syslog daemon that can do advanced processing and log centralization while maintaining a sane configuration file syntax. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come to vastly prefer it over my previous long term favorite Rsyslog.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that when modifying the logs statements, they will be processed in order. This means log statements that finalize a message will never make it past that statement. This finalization behavior can be a great tool for optimizing the processing path of logs but can result in unexpected behavior if you don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention when re-ordering the statements.</description>

      <title>Linux Audit Rule Paths</title>

      <description>I encountered a little bit of confusion while rewriting my auditd rules which some Googling did not help me solve.
When monitoring a file or directory there are two forms the rules can take. They are effectively equivalent in their functionality. The simpler form is the following format:
-w /etc/shadow -p wa -w /boot -p wa -w /etc/dont_readme -p r  These three rules are all behaving slightly differently. The first will audit any writes or attribute changes to the shadow file.</description>

      <description>This is a very basic operation on a Linux system, but I have to interact with it so rarely since I run either chronyd or ntpd on all of machines. Occasionally, I find a device that needs a helping hand.
On a device with a known good time (or approximate enough):
date +%s This will get you the current unix timestamp. On the target system needing updating as root (replacing &amp;lt;unix timestamp&amp;gt; with the results from the last command):</description>

      <title>The Case of an Empty Executable</title>

      <description>I recently came across a short article written about a decade ago. It was a curious thing already as it was hosted in a user&amp;rsquo;s home directory off a web server with the standard &amp;lsquo;~&amp;rsquo; showing up in the URL. The important part that caught my eye was this:
 The &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit status. This can be done with an empty file that&amp;rsquo;s marked executable, and that&amp;rsquo;s what it was in the earliest unix system libraries.</description>

      <title>Auditd</title>

      <description>Auditd collects any configured syscall execution with critical security metadata associated with the event. This can help enrich other security tools such as AIDE to determine what user and process are responsible for the change.
For reliable operation the rules should be carefully tuned to your system. Tracking every write to disk will generate an unreasonable amount of events and depending on the configuration of the kernel&amp;rsquo;s audit subsystem, may trigger a kernel panic.</description>

      <description>AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a file and directory integrity checker that compares the current hashes, permissions, and attributes of files directories against a known database built from the system.
This can be run periodically to detect manipulation of critical system files, though a motivated attacker with an appropriate level of permissions could modify this database or disable the check as long as the system is able to write to it.</description>

      <description>Smart Card NEO dnf install ykpers -y ykpersonalize -m82  Unplug and replug it back in and it should be usable as a smartcard.
NFC / HTTP Auth dnf install ykpers -y ykpersonalize -n https://api.stelfox.net/sessions/yknfc?t=  This will hit the API with a URL like:
https://api.stelfox.net/session/yknfc?t=ccccccuddclhrkuvurcufviveulljleihvreukifegjh  The API can then return a token that for accessing additional functionality.
Resetting This will wipe all keys, user, and admin pins on the card.</description>

      <description>I followed the TAILS setup guide to get a secure offline environment running to perform this generation task. The steps I took are documented in the tails document.
Initial Key Creation For simplicity I wanted to clear out the GnuPG configuration that starts out in place. Makes things a lot nicer later on.
rm -rf ~/.gnupg/*  I pulled in the .gnupg/gpg.conf from my dotfiles by hand.
And begin the key generation process</description>
