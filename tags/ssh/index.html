        <p>An update too Fedora a while ago started causing some unexpected behavior with
my dotfiles. Specifically the way I was handling my SSH agent. My SSH keys when
added to my agent automatically expire after a couple of hours.</p>

<p>After the update, when that expiration came I started receiving errors in my
shell that looked similar to the following (Since I fixed it I am not able to
get the exact working again):</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>Warning: Unable to connect to SSH agent
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>I also noticed that periodically I got a Gnome keyring popup asking for my SSH
agent rather than my command-line client. I&#39;m personally not a big fan of
Gnome, but I deal with because it&#39;s the default for Fedora, tends to stay out
of your way, and switching to something else is just not a project I&#39;ve had
time for.</p>

<p>Now Gnome was very much getting in my way. I dealt with it for several months
now and finally got sick of it.</p>

<p>I tracked this down too the <code>gnome-keyring-daemon</code> which was starting up and
clobbering the contents of my <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> variable along with my
<code>GPG_AGENT_INFO</code> environment. Not very friendly.</p>

<p>There were a couple paths that I could&#39;ve gone for for solving this situation.
The first, and easiest way to probably have dealt with this was too put some
logic into my <code>~/.bashrc</code> file that detected when the <code>gnome-keying-agent</code> was
running, kill it and clean up after it. It might look something like this:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>if [ -n &quot;${GNOME_KEYRING_PID}&quot; ]; then
  if $(kill -0 ${GNOME_KEYRING_PID}); then
    kill ${GNOME_KEYRING_PID}
  fi
fi

unset GNOME_KEYRING_CONTROL SSH_AUTH_SOCK GPG_AGENT_INFO GNOME_KEYRING_PID
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>I share my dotfiles along a lot of different systems and don&#39;t like
system-specific behaivior getting in there. Instead I choose to find what was
starting up the keyring daemon and preventing it from doing so. Without a good
place to start and stubbornly refusing to Google this particular problem I took
the brute force approach of grep for the binary name in the <code>/etc</code> directory.</p>

<p>Sure enough in <code>/etc/xdg/autostart</code> I found a series of background daemons that
I definitely did not want nor need running. As root I ran the following command
to purge them from my system:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>cd /etc/xdg/autostart
rm -f gnome-keyring-{gpg,pkcs11,secrets,ssh}.desktop \
  gnome-welcome-tour.desktop imsettings-start.desktop \
  evolution-alarm-notify.desktop caribou-autostart.desktop
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Make sure you read through that command as I&#39;m deleting more services than just
the Gnome keyring related daemons. The first solution will keep your system in
a default state, but this will permanently prevent the obnoxious behaivior on
your system for all users and prevents you from adding hacks to your bashrc to
work around mis-behaving software.</p>

<p>I hope this helps someone else!</p>
