title: 'Installing Amazon EC2 API & AMI Tools on Fedora 19'
---

While most software I need to make use of in my day is already available in the
Fedora repos, the Amazon EC2 API and AMI tools are sadly absent. Now that I've
gone through the process of getting the tools working, I wanted to make sure it
was documented for others to find..

Amazon makes the collections of relevant tools available via their [developer
tools site][1]. The two that are of interest to this blog post are the [API
tools][2] and the [AMI tools][3].
