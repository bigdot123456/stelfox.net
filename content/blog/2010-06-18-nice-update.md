I know I don't update this blog as often as I'd like and I have had a lot going
on in my project realms to put up here. That sadly is not what this short
little post is about. Normally, I really don't care about updates to WordPress.
I perform them diligently to prevent breaches into my sites, however they don't
really come with any other benefits.

This time however I was greeted with a clean refreshing theme. I've got to give
it to the WordPress UI designers on this one. It is simple and that's all that
I need.
