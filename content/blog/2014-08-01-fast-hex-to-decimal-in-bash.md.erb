I needed too turn some hexidecimal values into decimal in a bash script and
found a real easy way too do it. The following is a very short bash script
demostrating how too turn the hexidecimal string "deadbeefcafe" into it's
equivalent decimal value of "244837814094590".

```bash
#!/bin/bash

INPUT="deadbeefcafe"
OUTPUT=$((0x${INPUT}))

echo $OUTPUT
```
