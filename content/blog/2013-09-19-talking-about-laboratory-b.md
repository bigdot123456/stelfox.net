Recently Justin England and myself were interviewed on a local television
channel about the [local hackerspace](http://laboratoryb.org/) which we are
both founding members of.

We covered several general topics about hackerspaces, how the organization is
run, and some of the stuff we do at the Lab. Take a look if you're at all
interested in any of those!
