List all available bluetooth interfaces:

```bash
hciconfig -a
```

If you get an error like the following:

> Operation not possible due to RF-kill

You'll need to unblock access to the resource using rfkill. You can unblock all
blocked devices like so:

```bash
rfkill unblock all
```

Before doing any iBeacon stuff you should disable scanning:

```bash
hciconfig hci0 noscan
```

```bash
hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 1E 02 01 1A 1A FF 4C 00 02 15 [ 92 77 83 0A B2 EB 49 0F A1 DD 7F E3 8C 49 2E DE ] [ 00 00 ] [ 00 00 ] C5 00
hcitool -i hci0 leadv
```

> LE set advertise enable on hci1 returned status 12
