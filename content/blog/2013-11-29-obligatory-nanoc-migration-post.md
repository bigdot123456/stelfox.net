It's been a couple weeks since I migrated my site from my own personal static
site generator to the flexible [Nanoc][1] static site generator and it felt
like it was about time to write up this post.

This migration was a few months in the making as my devotion to the project
waxed in wane. The migration itself took relatively little time, most of the
work went into creating and refining a design I'd be able to live with for a
while, and importing content from my personal wiki (was previously wikipedia)
and documentation as I wasn't pleased with it's performance.
