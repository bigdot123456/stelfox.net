I'm a systems architect with a decade of experience of designing, configuring,
maintaining, and operating Linux environments. Currently, I'm developing
network sensors and the associated analytics platform for collecting and
processing network visibility and security information at [PwnieExpress][1].

I'm endlessly driven to create, to break, and find the solutions to the
problems I uncover. There is no rest from this task, there is always another
bigger, deeper, and more challenging problem to tackle.

My other major passion is books; There is nothing as exhilerating as holding
another world in your hands, washed in the smell of the tannins mingling with a
good cup of coffee in the morning.

You’re welcome to peruse my [LinkedIn][2] profile if you are interested in
learning more about my education or professional experience.
