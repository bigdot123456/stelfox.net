title: "About Myself"
type: page
---

I live and work out of the Burlington, VT area though I tend to travel all over
the state and to a lesser extent New England. I went to school at [Vermont
Technical College][1] for Software Engineering which was followed up as being
their Network & Systems Administrator. Currently I'm working at
[PwnieExpress][8] on a cloud intelligence platform.

I am an avid computer and network security enthusiast with a strong passion for
exploring the depths of Linux environments, though I am familiar with Windows
environments as well.

I'm endlessly driven to create, to break, and find the solutions to the
problems I uncover. There is no rest from this task, there is always another
bigger, deeper, and more challenging problem to tackle.

My other major passion is books; There is nothing as exhilerating as holding
another world in your hands, washed in the smell of the tannins mingling with a
good cup of coffee in the morning.

You’re welcome to peruse my [LinkedIn][2] profile if you are interested in
learning more about my education or professional experience or check out my
participation in the [StackExchange][3] sites.

If you’re in the Burlington, VT area and have a passion for electronics,
radios, fabrication processes, computer security, or programming I strongly
recommend you take a look at [Vermont’s First Hackerspace][4] of which I was
one of the founding members.

If you’d like to get ahold of me you can:

* send me a message [via email][5] (Probably the best choice)
* ping me on [Github][6]
* or reach out to me on [Twitter][7]
