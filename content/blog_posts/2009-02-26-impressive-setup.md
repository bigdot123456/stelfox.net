So I joined a project named VOOM (Very Open Object Model). It's a group of PHP
developers from around the world that all came together through the magic of
the PHP General Mailing List.

The group got together to build a set of common classes such as data validators
that developers could just drop into there code, much like PEAR. One of the
goals is a common standard covering code testing, coverage, format,
documentation and without the dependancies that are riddled throughout things
like PEAR. The project is not intended to be a framework or anything else like
that. Just high quality useful code available to the public.

The thing that is so impressive to me is first off how quickly the group not
only got together and organized but how quickly a full development environment
went up and became usable. We currently have an IRC channel, subversion,
automated testing, wiki, coding templates.

Most of that was done by one person in the group, Nathan Rixham. I've never
worked in any setup that... complete. Due too lack of time and creative
inspiration I still haven't though I'm really looking forward to it.
