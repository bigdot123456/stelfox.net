Hello dear netizen! I greatly appreciate your foray into my site. I'm currently
undergoing a transition to a new site, so please forgive the lack of design.

The entirety of the [Knowledge Base][1] section was more or less pulled
directly from my various notes and documentation directories. This means that
some of it may be outdate, overly verbose, incomplete, highly opinionated and
comes with no warantee.

I'll be rapidly updating this site with more information in the coming weeks,
adding a proper design, and cleaning up some of the content. If you feel you've
found something on my site worthwhile or in need of correction don't hesitate
to drop me a line. There are quite a few ways to get ahold of me, most of which
are documented on my [about page][2].
