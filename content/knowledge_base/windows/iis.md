# IIS

## WebDAV

For remote access to files and "network drives". Was used to replace FTP with
something that can have a certificate slapped on it. This was done on a Windows
Server 2008R2 Enterprise SP1 box.

### Web Server Setup

In the IIS Manager I created two "Sites" one bound to port 80 ("Informational
Site") the other to port 443 ("WebDAV Drives"). They are both pointing at
I:\wwwroot which has a simple information page about the different WebDAV
shares. The root folder needed read/execute permissions for the local
"IIS_IUSRS" group to function properly. The shares do not seem to have the same
permissions restrictions.

In the site bound to port 443 with a valid certificate I created a bunch of
virtual directories each pointing at one 'share'.

### Global Configuration

* Authentication
  * Only Anonymous Authentication turned on
* Compression
  * Both kinds of compression are on
  * Static Compression
    * Only compress files larger than (in bytes): 2700
    * Cache directory: %SystemDrive%\inetpub\temp\IIS Temporary Compressed Files
    * Per application pool disk space limit (in MB): 100
* Default Document
  * Only index.html
* Directory Browsing
  * Disabled
* Error Pages
  * I left the defaults
* Handler Mappings
  * I left the defaults however it might be best to remove the OPTIONS, TRACE, and WebDAV from the global options and just configure WebDAV on the sub folders.
* HTTP Redirect
  * I left the defaults
* HTTP Response Headers
  * I left the defaults
* IP Address and Domain Restrictions
  * I left the defaults
* Logging
  * One log file per: Site
  * Format: W3C w/ default fields
  * Directory: %SystemDrive%\inetpub\logs\LogFiles
  * Encoding: UTF-8
  * Log File Rollover: Schedule - Daily
* MIME Types
  * I left the defaults
* Modules
* Output Caching
* Request Filtering
* Server Certificates
* WebDAV Authoring Rules
  * WebDAV Settings
* Worker Processes

#### Informational Site

Nothing special I just crafted an index.html that explained how to connect and
use the WebDAV shares.

#### WebDAV Drives

* Directory Browsing - Enable
* Request Filtering
  * Hidden Segments - Add - 'web.config'
* WebDAV Authoring Rules
  * Add Authoring Rule:
