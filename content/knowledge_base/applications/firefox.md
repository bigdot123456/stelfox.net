## Plugins

First off disable all the plugins that come with firefox, none of them are good
for me. I want my media in my media applications. If you've already installed
  flash you probably want to leave that one on (as it's the only place I ever
  use flash).

Install the following plugins:

* Adblock Plus
  * After installation and restarting Firefox turn Automatic Updates on for this plugin.
* Firebug
* Flashblock
  * After installation and restarting Firefox, tell it to block silverlight as well (this isn't as important on Linux distros)
  * Add 'reddit.com' and 'youtube.com' to it's whitelist.
* HTTPS-Everywhere (https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)
* Reddit Enhancement Suite (http://redditenhancementsuite.com/)
* Convergence (http://convergence.io/)
