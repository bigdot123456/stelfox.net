# SSHd

Secure Shell or SSH is a network protocol that allows data to be exchanged
using a secure channel between two networked devices. Used primarily on
GNU/Linux and Unix based systems to access shell accounts, SSH was designed as
a replacement for Telnet and other insecure remote shells, which send
information, notably passwords, in plaintext, rendering them susceptible to
packet analysis. The encryption used by SSH provides confidentiality and
integrity of data over an insecure network, such as the Internet.

## Security Notes

SSH is one of the crux services. An improperly configured SSH could be
equivalent to letting an attacker have physical access to the box.

Generally it's recommended to run any instances of SSH exposed to the public
internet on an alternate port. This won't protect you against vulnerabilities
but it will drastrically reduce the number of automated and scripted attacks
your server will be subjected to. If nothing else it will allow real attacks to
stand out more clearly in your logs.

## Firewall Adjustments

My default [IPTables][1] firewall already has the following rules in place to
allow access to SSH by default while still providing a modicum of protection
from attackers.

```
# Allow SSH, but no more than 5 new connections every minute Note: This has
# extreme repercussions if I was to use sftp as each file transfer initiates a
# new connection. Since it's rare for me to use sftp this isn't really an
# issue, however, when I do want to use it this rule will be the cause of
# failed transfers. Hopefully I will save myself the diagnostic nightmare
# scenario I went through last time
-A INPUT -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --name SSH --set
-A INPUT -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 5 --rttl --name SSH -j LOG --log-prefix "SSH Brute Force"
-A INPUT -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 5 --rttl --name SSH -j DROP
-A INPUT -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
```

## Configuration

### /etc/ssh/sshd_config

The following is a minimal SSH config relying mostly on the defaults. It
requires a group named `sshers` to be created before hand and any user that
should have legitimate access via SSH should be added to the group.

```
Banner /etc/issue.net

ClientAliveInterval 60
TCPKeepAlive no

SyslogFacility AUTHPRIV
UseDNS no

PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM yes

AllowTcpForwarding no
AllowGroups sshers

# Accept locale-related environment variables
AcceptEnv LANG LC_CTYPE LC_NUMERIC LC_TIME LC_COLLATE LC_MONETARY LC_MESSAGES
AcceptEnv LC_PAPER LC_NAME LC_ADDRESS LC_TELEPHONE LC_MEASUREMENT
AcceptEnv LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_ALL LANGUAGE
```

### /etc/issue.net

The net issue file is what gets displayed before a user logs in. While I'm
under no false pretense that having a policy displayed to a potential attacker
will prevent them from their malicious activity, it is generally recommended by
law enforcement to ensure that notice of unauthorized access was given prior.

At a minimum it will show the server has been professionally configured and
that they are not dealing with a service that was left unconfigured.

## Multi-Factor Authentication

I would like to start out by mentioning yes, I know I'm paranoid. I have no
reason to explicitly believe that there is anyone actively trying to get into
my network and additionally I have no reason to believe that the data I'm
protecting has any value to anyone but myself. My response to anyone who thinks
this is excessive is, just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean someone isn't out
to get me. Besides what's the harm in adding another almost non-intrusive
security measure to the system?

Multi-factor authentication is using three or more different types of user
verification schemes to provide a considerably harder time for an unauthorized
user to gain access. These verification schemes can include but are not limited
to:

* Access control (firewall port restrictions or user ACL conditions)
* Something you know (your password or pass phrase)
* Something you have (your ssh key or secure id key-fob hardware)
* Something you are (fingerprint or iris scan)
* Somebody you know (human authentication through mutual acquaintance)
* Something you deduce (logical authentication which the user will need to
  reason, usually based on personal knowledge or life experience)

Multi-factor authentication can easily be implemented on these using built-in
functionality. Multiple verifications of the same type do not count towards the
number of verification schemes in use (for example both firewall and restrict
by user are both ACLs and thus count as one verification scheme) although they
can still increase the security of the box. Assuming that the server is
configured according to the guidelines on this wiki in regards to [IPTables][1]
and SSH, then it already has the following:

* limit access by group with the "AllowGroups" directive (whitelist - access
  control)
* use a password (something you know)

We can further increase the security into a true multi-factor authentication
system by disabling password based access and requiring the following:

* limit access to ssh by ip address (access control)
* use a pre-authorized ssh key (something you have)
* use that ssh key _with_ a strong pass-phrase (something you know)
* force a script to run on login that will ask questions of the user (logical
  authentication of a constantly changing answer)

The first can be done using [IPTables][1] and the rules are mentioned in the
firewall section of this page. I will cover the rest in the following two
sub-sections.

Note for personal research: It seems that version 2 of the SSH protocol
natively supports chaining authentications using the 'AuthenticationMethods'
commands allowing you to simply do things such as requiring you to have both a
key and password. Chaining this with pam could allow us to require a publickey,
following by standard password, and finishing up with a OTP. Would be fantastic
for high security airlock servers, or as a stronger means of restricting root
logins where they are necessary.

### SSH Authorized Keys

SSH authorized keys provide a considerably stronger authentication method than
a user's password as long as the key is protected by a pass-phrase. If the key
is left without a pass-phrase, anyone who manages to get access to the system
can immediately login as that user anywhere they have deployed the key. Ensure
there is a strong pass-phrase on the key.

The keys are normally created as `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`,
however I like to physically separate my keys from my computers so I'll give my
keys a descriptive name of `username@host.key` and put them on a pendrive
located at `/media/pendrive`. Personally I to use keys with 4096 bits. The
following command will create the public / private keys:

```
[user@localhost ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f /media/pendrive/username@host.key
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /media/pendrive/username@host.key.
Your public key has been saved in /media/pendrive/username@host.key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx user@localhost
```

Now that we have a strong key we just need to place it on the servers we want
to access. Conveniently enough there is a utility that makes this quick and
simple, if for some reason you don't trust this utility or want to do it by
hand just copy the contents of username@host.key.pub into
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote host and make sure the file's
permissions are set to 0400.

You can use the utility by performing the following command, replacing
`remoteuser@remotehost` with a valid username and hostname for the remote host.

```
[user@localhost ~]$ ssh-copy-id -i /media/pendrive/username@host.key.pub remoteuser@remotehost
remoteuser@remotehost's password: 
Now try logging into the machine, with "ssh 'remoteuser@remotehost'", and check in:

  .ssh/authorized_keys

to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.

[user@localhost ~]$ ssh -i /media/pendrive/username@host.key remoteuser@remotehost
Enter passphrase for key '/media/pendrive/username@remotehost.key':
[remoteuser@remotehost ~]$
```

Once your sure that the key based login is working you can safely disable
password based logins through ssh to the system entirely by changing the
following line in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```
PasswordAuthentication yes
---- Replace with ----
PasswordAuthentication no
```

This replaces the 'something you know' of a password based login, with
'something you have' (the key, especially if it's on a pendrive) and 'something
you know' (the key's pass-phrase).

### Gatekeeper Script

If you've already implemented the SSH keys for authentication and have a
password on your key then you've already achieved multi-factor authentication,
as I've said before now I'm paranoid and any additional step that could keep
the baddies out of the systems that I need to ensure the security of is a step
that I'll take.

The gatekeeper script is something that I haven't come across on any other
systems that other people administer. Perhaps they haven't thought of it, or
perhaps it's too much trouble for them without much gain. I had the idea for
this while watching a James Bond movie (Golden Eye for those who care). A
Russian systems engineer put riddles on one of his machines that you had to go
through in order to access the system, while this alone isn't secure, asking
the user a random question that they alone would know the answer to couldn't
hurt the security. I highly recommend using some logic that changes
periodically, but the client can remotely deduce.

First we need to make a script to handle the additional authentication.Please
note that the following script is just an example, posting the actual script
would defeat the purpose of having it in the first place. You'll have to come
up with your own question and answer sections, though this is a good template
to start from.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Gatekeeper.sh - Post-login authentication script

# In the event that a user tries to get crafty and Ctrl-C out of the script
# we'll just kill the connection
trap jail INT
jail() {
    kill -9 $PPID
    exit 0
}

# Once a user logs in, check to see if they just wanted a shell.
# SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND will be null (-z) if they did
if [ -z "$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" ]; then
    # The answer the user needs to know, a function or call to another
    # script could be used to generate this answer based on any number
    # of resources available to the system. This could include querying an
    # internal web script to get a daily password user's of a site have
    # access to (and perhaps are supposed to be checking)
    CORRECT_ANSWER="muffins"

    # Message displayed to the user before being prompted, I'm going to assume
    # the user knows the question in this case what's the admin's favorite
    # breakfast
    echo -n "Gatekeeper token authentication required: "

    # Get the user's answer. If the answer is correct execute the command.
    # If the answer is wrong, log the attempt and kill the connection.
    while read -s inputline; do
        RESPONSE="$inputline"
        echo ""
        if [ $CORRECT_ANSWER = "${RESPONSE}" ]; then
            echo "Gatekeeper authentication accepted."
            $SHELL -l
            exit 0
        else
            logger "Gatekeeper: $USER login failed from $SSH_CLIENT"
            kill -9 $PPID
            exit 0
        fi
    done
fi

# This command will bypass the gatekeeper script if the user tries to rsync
# as this script will break rsync. It creates a fresh shell just for good
# measure.
#if [ `echo $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND | awk '{print $1}'` = rsync ]; then
#    $SHELL -c "$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND"
#    exit 0
#fi

# If a user tried to execute something other than an 'approved' command
# just kill the session. This will prevent SCP and SFTP unless they are
# configured to bypass the script.
kill -9 $PPID
exit 0
```

Put this script in `/etc/ssh/gatekeeper.sh` and change it's permissions to 755
with the owner being root. To make the SSH server pass off control to the
Gatekeeper script once it's done authenticating a user, we'll use the
'ForceCommand' command in SSHd's config file (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`). Add the
following line to the end of the config and restart the SSH daemon.

```
ForceCommand /etc/ssh/gatekeeper.sh
```

Assuming everything went according to plan, when you SSH into the remote server
once your done authenticating it'll ask for the token. Putting in 'muffins'
should get you to your shell, while anything else will kill the connection.
This provides the final layer of the multi-factor authentication as 'something
you deduce'.

## User Jails

Jails can isolate users from sensitive parts of the system, creating a 'fake'
environment for them to execute their programs. In the event that a user's
account becomes compromised, the jail can limit what an attacker has access too
though it should be considered a delay rather than a security measure since a
determined hacker might be able to break out of an otherwise secure jail.

To start off we're going to need to setup an environment for our jail. The
following commands create the base directories and the /dev/null device within
the jail.

```
[root@localhost]# mkdir -p /var/jail/{dev,etc,lib,lib64,usr/bin,bin,home}
[root@localhost]# chown -R root:root /var/jail/
[root@localhost]# mknod -m 666 /var/jail/dev/null c 1 3
```

There is something serious to note here. The [partitioning][2] security
guidelines add two flags to the mount options of the /var partition.  You will
need to remove the 'nosuid', and 'noexec' options from this partition to be
able use a chroot jail.

Next we need to copy a few minimum files into the jail's etc directory. Hard
links may work better for these as they will get properly updated with the rest
of the system, however, I am unsure whether or not that would actually work.

```
[root@localhost]# cp /etc/ld.so.cache /etc/ld.so.conf /etc/nsswitch.conf /etc/hosts /var/jail/etc/
```

At this point you need to decide what commands you want you're user to have
access too and copy the appropriate binaries into place. You can use the
`which` command to locate a binary and then copy it into the same directory
within the jail. The following is an example for moving `bash` over.

```
[root@localhost]# which bash
/bin/bash
[root@localhost]# cp /bin/bash /var/jail/bin/
```

The trickiest part of setting up a jail is the required libraries for the
allowed executables. Conveniently, all the Linux distributions that I have
tried come with a tool too determine what libraries are required. `ldd`. Here's
a little snippet that will give you a run down of the counts for the number of
times each library is used by a system:

```
find /bin -type f -perm /a+x -exec ldd {} \; \
| grep so \
| sed -e '/^[^\t]/ d' \
| sed -e 's/\t//' \
| sed -e 's/.*=..//' \
| sed -e 's/ (0.*)//' \
| sort \
| uniq -c \
| sort -n
```

If for some reason ldd isn't reporting all of the libraries, while the app is
running you can use this command to track down what it has actually loaded:

```
lsof -P -T -p Application_PID
```

If you want to run sshd in a LXC container you will need to disable
`pam_loginuid.so` in `/etc/pam.d/sshd` by commenting out the appropriate line.
