# LM Sensors

Useful for monitoring system statistics such as CPU core temperatures. After
installing the lm_sensors packages you can run the 'sensors-detect' command
that will walk you through loading any kernel modules that may be necessary to
read sensor data. Executing the 'sensors' command will output the results of
all of that nice information :)
