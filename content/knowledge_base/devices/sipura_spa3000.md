title: Sipura SPA3000
---

Getting this working properly with incoming, and outgoing calls through the FXO
port and as a standard extension through the FXS port was quite a trick so I've
documented all of my configuration notes of what was required to get it too
work here. They're pretty crude but you can follow them easy enough, each
indentation level indicates a tab or section, while the actual settings are
reflected in a key: value pair.
