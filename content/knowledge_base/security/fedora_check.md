title: Fedora Check

## TODO

* Find a way to only update files affected by the update and no others.
* Only update the aide database ''if there were updates to be applied''
* Keep the SHA1 and MD5 hashes in a file outside of the scripts

## Source

You will more likely than not need to update the SHA1 and MD5 signatures of the
files. Ensure that all of the binaries are available on the system.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# Executables used by this script
YUM="/usr/bin/yum"
AIDE="/usr/sbin/aide"
RPM="/bin/rpm"
SHA1="/usr/bin/sha1sum"
MD5="/usr/bin/md5sum"
AWK="/bin/awk"

# These are used to verify the integrity of our HIDS early in the script

# This function should get triggered if there are any signs of a potential
# security breach on this system. It would be nice to be able to leave a tag

# place it'll need to change.
