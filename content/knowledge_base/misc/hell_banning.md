title: Hell Banning
---

A hellbanned user is invisible to all other users, but crucially, not himself.
From their perspective, they are participating normally in the community but
nobody ever responds to them. They can no longer disrupt the community because
they are effectively invisible. It’s a clever way of enforcing the “don’t feed
the troll” rule in the community. When nothing they post ever gets a response,
a hellbanned user is likely to get bored or frustrated and leave.
