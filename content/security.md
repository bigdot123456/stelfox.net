title: Security Acknowledgements
---

Thank you for taking the time to consider the security of other people! If
you've found a security vulnerability with any of my infrastructure, I'd
greatly appreciate an [email][1]. If the vulnerability is sensitive enough,
please consider encrypting the contents with my [public key][2].

For additional confidence that key is controlled by me, I encourage you to
check the [proofs I've published][3] on Keybase.

As soon as I receive any reports, I'll respond as soon as possible then begin
confirming it myself. Once I've addressed the issue I'll publish both an
acknowledgement on this page and write a post on addressing the vulnerability.
You're welcome (and I encourage you) to publish your analysis and I will
happily link to it in both places.

Alternatively, if one the configs I've published on my site has a flaw I'd love
to hear about that as well and will also give you an acknowledgement here and
on the page with the effected config.

## Acknowledgements

*Currently, I haven't received any security reports. Thanks for your
consideration*
