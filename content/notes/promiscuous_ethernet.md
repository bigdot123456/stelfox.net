# Promiscuous Ethernet

Redhat used to to include a way to enable promiscuous mode in the network
configuration scripts. This was deprecated and no longer available but can be
restored by creating / adding to the `/sbin/ifup-local` file:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

RC=0

PROM=$(egrep -i 'promisc' /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-$1 | awk -F"=" '{ print $2 }')

if [ "$PROM" = "yes" ]; then
  /usr/sbin/ip link set dev $1 promisc on
  #/sbin/ifconfig $1 promisc
  RC=$?
fi

exit $RC
```

You can then use this in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` like files
by adding "PROMISC=yes" somewhere in it. This is untested.
