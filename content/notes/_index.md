title: Various Notes
---

This section contains notes on various services and systems I've explored or
setup. These are frequently stream of conciousness notes and may have dead
ends, multiple attempts, or be outdated. I periodically go through them and
attempt to rewrite them to make them more consumable by others and myself.

I hope these can help guide people on their own attempts to understand the
services that they host. Please always double check the facts and don't take a
random netizen's personal assessment will match your use cases.
