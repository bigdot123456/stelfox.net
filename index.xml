      <description>Auditd collects any configured syscall execution with critical security metadata associated with the event. This can help enrich other security tools such as AIDE to determine what user and process are responsible for the change.
For reliable operation the rules should be carefully tuned to your system. Tracking every write to disk will generate an unreasonable amount of events and depending on the configuration of the kernel&amp;rsquo;s audit subsystem, may trigger a kernel panic.</description>

      <description>AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a file and directory integrity checker that compares the current hashes, permissions, and attributes of files directories against a known database built from the system.
This can be run periodically to detect manipulation of critical system files, though a motivated attacker with an appropriate level of permissions could modify this database or disable the check as long as the system is able to write to it.</description>

      <description>Smart Card NEO dnf install ykpers -y ykpersonalize -m82  Unplug and replug it back in and it should be usable as a smartcard.
NFC / HTTP Auth dnf install ykpers -y ykpersonalize -n https://api.stelfox.net/sessions/yknfc?t=  This will hit the API with a URL like: https://api.stelfox.net/session/yknfc?t=ccccccuddclhrkuvurcufviveulljleihvreukifegjh
The API can then return a token that for accessing additional functionality.

      <description>I followed the TAILS setup guide to get a secure offline environment running to perform this generation task. The steps I took are documented in the tails document.
Initial Key Creation For simplicity I wanted to clear out the GnuPG configuration that starts out in place. Makes things a lot nicer later on.
rm -rf ~/.gnupg/*  I pulled in the .gnupg/gpg.conf from my dotfiles by hand.
And begin the key generation process</description>

Warning: The driver descriptor says the physical block size is 2048 bytes, but Linux says it is 512 bytes.  The only thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to find anywhere about this is &amp;ldquo;a low-level device tool (like dd) wrote blocks at the wrong size directly onto the device&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>GRE encapsulates all layer 2 traffic, but does so through an unencrypted tunnel. Sensitive traffic should exclusively go through a lower level encrypted tunnel like IPSec.
Firewall The following iptables need to be enabled to allow the GRE traffic to and from the system. This should be restricted to / from IP addresses as well.

      <title>Better Practices With Sudo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with a lot of different linux machines from embedded devices, to cloud
servers and open stack hosts. For many of them I&amp;rsquo;m either the sole
administrator or one of three or less with administrative access. Where there
are multiple administrative users, we all are generally working as backups to
each other. We use sudo whenever we need to execute a task with privileges on
any of these machines with no direct root login permitted remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must confess I have established two habits over time that are against best
practices with regard to sudo; Using it to execute a root shell only, and not
restricting which commands can be run with sudo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I use Rakefiles quite a bit like traditional Makefiles, in that I specify immediate dependencies for an individual task and Rake will execute all of them. If a file or directory is the dependency and it exists, the task that creates it will be skipped. A contrieved Rakefile example might look like:
file &amp;#39;sample&amp;#39; do |t| puts &amp;#39;Creating sample directory&amp;#39; Dir.mkdir(t.name) end file &amp;#39;sample/population.txt&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; [&amp;#39;sample&amp;#39;] do |t| puts &amp;#39;Creating sample population file.</description>

      <description>I like getting unopionated feedback on the quality of the code I write. Sometimes I can get this from other developers but they tend to get annoyed being asked after every commit whether they consider it an approvement.
There are a few utilities for Ruby codebases such as flay, flog, and rubocop as well as hosted services such as Code Climate that can help you identify chunks of code that can use some work.</description>

      <description>Every now and then I find myself wanting to create a new empty branch in an existing repository. It&amp;rsquo;s useful for things such as Github Pages so you&amp;rsquo;re able to keep your content source in the master branch while only keeping the output in the gh-pages branch. I&amp;rsquo;ve also used it for testing a complete rewrite of a code base without the overhead of creating a new repo and copying access permissions.</description>

      <description>I need to filter a live logstream for only relevant events and quickly hit an issue that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting. The grep in my pipe chain was waiting until it received all the output from the prior command before it began to attempt to filter it.
Reading through the grep man page I came across the --line-buffered flag which provides exactly what I needed. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using the tail command but it serves really well in this situation to demonstrate the use:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with my Nexus 5 lately. It was quickly rooted and I began playing with various ROMs that had been pre-built for the Nexus 5. My first stop was the CyanogenMod. Since I&amp;rsquo;d last used CyanogenMod they added a built-in framework that provides transparent text message encryption called WhisperPush.
WhisperPush is an implementation of Moxie Marlinspike&amp;rsquo;s highly respected TextSecure and I was very excited at the possibility of using it.</description>

      <title>Using OpenWRT&#39;s Dnsmasq as a TFTP Server</title>

      <description>I recently reflashed my primary router to a newer version of OpenWRT and attempted to follow my own directions written in an earlier blog post to add PXE booting to my local network using the dnsmasq service built in. After following my advice I found that the dnsmasq service wasn&amp;rsquo;t starting.
Looking into the logread output I finally saw that this was due too a permission issue. Combining this with the output of ps too identify the user that dnsmasq was running on I was able to both modify my instructions and use OpenWRT&amp;rsquo;s own config system to perform the configuration instead of modifying the dnsmasq configuration.</description>

      <description>I randomly started experiencing an issue with one blade in one of my PowerEdge C6100 blades. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t obey all commands issued too it via IPMI or through the BMC&amp;rsquo;s web interface. Additionally the blade would randomly power on when off, and the front light would consistently blink as if a hardware fault was detected.
This has been bothering me for a while, but it was my spare blade and wasn&amp;rsquo;t affecting my lab in anyway so I&amp;rsquo;ve ignored it.</description>

      <description>The current large project I&amp;rsquo;m working on is going to be hosted on AWS and I was requested to do a cost estimate. Looking into it, it quickly became clear that reserved instances could potentially save quite a bit of cash but there was a catch (isn&amp;rsquo;t there alway).
There is an upfront cost for reserving the instance and in exchange you get a reduced hourly rate. After running the numbers one thing wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear too me, is the upfront cost credit towards running machines or a fee you never see again?</description>

      <description>Before I describe the issue that I encountered, let me be very clear. This hack is potentially dangerous and should absolutely only be done in development environments. This won&amp;rsquo;t affect your host system, only the docker container so the most damage you&amp;rsquo;ll do is prevent hostname and possibly user/group lookups within the container itself.
Alright with that out of the way, I was actively working on a codebase that uses subdomains as part of the identifier.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with building a pure javascript full text search engine for static content sites like this one. One of the challenges with doing this has been working around the Markdown markup embedded in the written content.
Most of the markdown syntax can be stripped out simply by removing all non-alphanumeric characters from the document and move on. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve one of the bigger challenges I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced&amp;hellip; code blocks.</description>

It seems that while Rails 4 supports the HStore datatype, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t enable the extension itself. I&amp;rsquo;ve found two ways too solve this issue in wildly different ways.
First Solution: Enable HStore by Default This is the common solution that is recommended too solve this issue.</description>

      <description>I regularily find myself working on projects that involve the manipulation and storage of RSA keys. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve never had to worry about identification or presentation of these keys. Normally I&amp;rsquo;ve only got one too three pairs at most that I&amp;rsquo;m manipulating (server, certificate authority, client).
I&amp;rsquo;ve not found myself working on a project that involves presenting the certificates to users for selection and comparison. The obvious way too do this is take a page out of other developer&amp;rsquo;s books and present the key&amp;rsquo;s fingerprint.</description>

echo -e &amp;#34;XX\n\n \n \n\n$(hostname)\n\n&amp;#34; | openssl req -new -x509 -newkey \  rsa:2048 -keyout service.key -nodes -days 90 -out service.crt &amp;amp;&amp;gt; /dev/null The cert uses the hostname of whatever machine you generated it on.</description>

      <description>Anyone that has used SSH, Tmux or Screen for a while will have inevitably dumped excessive output to their terminal. Depending on the size of the output you may have experienced the dreaded lockup. That horrible realization seconds after you hit the command where signals just stop working and you just have to sit there and wait for your terminal to catch up.
There is a piece of remote connection software called Mosh that I&amp;rsquo;ve been told handles this pretty well, but I don&amp;rsquo;t yet trust its security model and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent the same thing from happening locally.</description>

      <description>While working through a problem I found it would be immensely useful to be able to enumerate all of the current subclasses of a particular class. After thinking about this for a while I settled on a good old friend of mine, ObjectSpace.
For those not familiar with the ObjectSpace module, it is a means to inspect and access the items being tracked by Ruby&amp;rsquo;s garbage collector. This means it has a hook into every living object, and more dangerously, every near-death object.</description>

      <guid>https://stelfox.net/blog/2014/02/creating-crypt-style-sha512-passwords-with-ruby/</guid>
      <description>I needed to generate crypt-style SHA512 passwords in ruby for an /etc/shadow file. After a bunch of Googling and messing around with the OpenSSL library I finally found a very simple built-in way to handle this.
require &amp;#39;securerandom&amp;#39; &amp;#39;password&amp;#39;.crypt(&amp;#39;$6$&amp;#39; + SecureRandom.random_number(36 ** 8).to_s(36)) You&amp;rsquo;ll get a string that looks like:
$6$4dksjo1b$Lt194Dwy7r/7WbM8MezYZysmGcxjaiisgTrTBbHkyBZFXeqQTG0J5hep4wLM/AmYxlGNLRy0OWATLDZCqjwCk.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the SecureRandom module you can replace the random call with simply rand(36 ** 8) though this isn&amp;rsquo;t recommended.</description>

The system timezone is controlled by the /etc/localtime file and is generally symlinked to locale files stored in /usr/share/zoneinfo. Generally I like to keep my systems on UTC as I my machines are in several timezones and it makes all the logs have consistent times.</description>

After searching around quite a bit I found the resources lacking for explaining how to perform these updates. So in this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to quickly cover updating the BMC firmware on each blade.
The system I received had four different versions of the BMC software installed, additionally Two were branded as MegaRAC and the others branded as Dell.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t have any legal copies of Windows to put on my server and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go through all that effort`
It really needs to be done within a DOS environment. I downloaded the file PEC6100BIOS017000.exe from Dell&amp;rsquo;s support website (locally hosted copy) as well as the 2.</description>

I found myself in need of a TFTP server but wanted to avoid having all of the xinet.d packages and services on my system (even if they were disabled). While looking for alternatives I found out that dnsmasq has a built-in read-only TFTP server.</description>

      <description>I needed to support PXE booting on my home network. I use OpenWRT as my main router and DHCP server and it took me a bit of searching how to configure the BOOTP next server to redirect local clients to my Arch TFTP/NFS server for booting, so I&amp;rsquo;m placing the config here to help others who might be looking to do the same thing.
It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that this isn&amp;rsquo;t a guide on setting up PXE booting completely on an OpenWRT, you&amp;rsquo;ll need another system that is running a configured TFTP server.</description>

The following will return all of them in Javascript&amp;rsquo;s equilvalent of a hash (or dictionary if you prefer) in the form of an object.</description>

It seems like backing up was a hot enough topic that the Google Gmail team are releasing an official backup method. It&amp;rsquo;s not completely in the wild yet but I definitely look forward to poking around in it.
Now if only Google let you download everything they know about you as well&amp;hellip; Would definitely make for an interesting read.</description>

Drones have been getting more and more popular, and more accessible. They&amp;rsquo;ve been getting used by the military, law enforcement, recently Amazon (though they&amp;rsquo;ve abandoned that for now), you can even purchase one for your iPhone at airports.
The security of these systems hasn&amp;rsquo;t been thoroughly tested publicly, though there is at least one report of a military drone being stolen already.</description>

      <description>There are all kinds of password managers out there. Everything from web services that are quite solid and respectible, to native desktop apps.
A lot of these are simply too heavy for me, involve installing software on a computer to access in addition to sharing the file around, or required you to remember multiple account details before you could get access to any individual password.
Due too the various complexities and lack of matching use cases a couple years ago I set out to develop my own open-source version of Passpack.</description>

      <description>This morning I found myself in need of a large set of emails to test a particular set of code. Ideally these emails would be broken out into easily digestable pieces, and it was strictly for my own personal testing so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t concerned with using my own live data for this test (There will probably be another post on this project later on).
Having used fetchmail with good results in the past I decided it was a good idea to take this opportunity to also backup my Gmail account into the common Maildir format (which essentially breaks out emails into individual files meeting my requirements).</description>

      <description>Recently while writing a Ruby program I needed to parse some command line options. Helpfully Ruby provides a module named OptionParser to make this easy. I found a few parts of the documentation ambiguous and a few others down right confusing.
The catch I hit was the required field. In my mind the definition of a required argument is something that needs to be passed on the commandline to continue. What OptionParser actually means is that a value isn&amp;rsquo;t required when the argument is passed.</description>

Looking back on the code I see some things I&amp;rsquo;m impressed with, but the majority of the code I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t write today. Thats not to say the code is bad, or doesn&amp;rsquo;t function. It did exactly what I wanted to accomplish at the time, just not necessarily in the most efficient way.
This archive of old code made me start wondering how much old code I&amp;rsquo;m using in the projects that I&amp;rsquo;m currently writing.</description>

Since we use Heroku for our development platform I needed to not only reset the credentials for the web portion (which conveniently also handles resetting the API key) but also revoke any SSH keys he may have added to access it.
Sadly Heroku does not seem to provide any web interface that I could find for examining what keys were associated with the account.</description>

Outside of the uploader, you can use the File utility and the URL of the object to get the base filename like so:</description>

When I went searching I found quite a bit of information about similar projects in Python, and PHP named DataMapper but nothing about the ruby &amp;ldquo;data_mapper&amp;rdquo;. The search continued eventually ending in my reading through the source of the data_mapper gem only to find that there was no feature for simply defining a prefix.</description>

      <description>For the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a Ruby project that needed to interact with a remote XMLRPC API. This isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly unusual but it was the first time from within a Ruby application. Luckily enough Ruby has a built in XMLRPC client that handles a lot of the messy bits.
The XMLRPC::Client class itself seems fairly simple. There are only a handful of methods, five of which are for opening a new connection in a few different ways, and at least two ways to open each type of connection.</description>

      <description>So I found a dirt cheap video SIP phone (ACN Iris 3000) at a local HAM fest. After looking around I found the vendor has locked in the phone with their specific service with an iron grip and had gone out of business. I guess I should expect that kind of anti-competitive behavior from a business that Donald Trump has a vested interest in.
I&amp;rsquo;ve come across one post on a forum that seems to have been crawled and copied out every where.</description>

      <description>So I recently did a fresh install of Fedora 14 with KDE installed (not the KDE spin mind you) on my ThinkPad. I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised with hows it&amp;rsquo;s working everything seems to be working out the box very stably. I used it without issue for a solid month and a half without a single issue.
Earlier this week I started having issues with my wireless card on some networks, but not at all of them.</description>

      <description>One of the hot-topics for IPv6 (which I have been thinking about a lot lately) is NAT. I normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go into detail about specifics that are obvious to people in my field but for the sake of this post I will. NAT or Network Address Translation, is a way for a large number of computers to share a single public IP address.
The router that is handling the NAT will keep track of connections coming in and out of it and re-write the destination IP to an internal address to keep the traffic flowing.</description>

      <description>I wrote a simple web crawler that archived any images it found from a site with a large number of backgrounds. I wanted to have rolling backgrounds that almost never repeated.
I let my crawler go and stopped it after a 24 hour period. I ran ls on the directory the images were being saved in to see the results and my ssh session locked up&amp;hellip; Or so I thought. I hit Ctrl-C and nothing happened&amp;hellip; So I closed my window and opened a new one.</description>

Asterisk is a software implementation of a telephone private branch exchange (PBX) originally created in 1999 by Mark Spencer of Digium. Like any PBX, it allows attached telephones to make calls to one another, and to connect to other telephone services including the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services.</description>

      <description>Recovering Data from Swap Sometimes useful bits of information can be recovered from swap. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s encryption keys, documents that were being worked on or anything else that might&amp;rsquo;ve ended up in RAM. To search through the swap for interesting bits (and depending on the size this might take a while) you can execute the following command as root or sudo to do it:
[root@localhost ~]# strings `/bin/swapon -s | tail -1 | awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;` | less  The command above uses the swapon utility to list all of the swap devices in use; look at the last line of the output (most people only have one swap device); extract only the path to the device node.</description>

Duplicity is a command line backup utility that makes use of the rsync libraries to perform incremental backups. It also can use GPG public/private keypairs to handle backing up and restoring files.
I personally want to use public / private key pairs for my backups and contrary with what I do most of the time I share a single public / private key pair for my backups, with a strong pass string on the private key.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve already implemented the SSH keys for authentication and have a password on your key then you&amp;rsquo;ve already achieved multi-factor authentication to a certain degree.
The gatekeeper script is something that I haven&amp;rsquo;t come across on any other systems that other people administer. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s too much trouble for them without much gain. I had the idea for this while watching a James Bond movie.
A Russian systems engineer put riddles on one of his machines that you had to go through in order to access the system, while this alone isn&amp;rsquo;t secure, asking the user random questions after authentication couldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt security.</description>

IP6Tables is the firewall that will directly effect IPv6 traffic. This is sample configuration is restricted to allow normal client activity but has no open ports.
Security Notes While turning off IPv6 is definitely one way to handle blocking IPv6 traffic, if I left ip6tables off or in it&amp;rsquo;s default state and an update re-enabled IPv6 in the networking stack somehow it would be as good as having no firewall against any attacker that noticed.</description>

The device name will more likely than not be either eth0 or em1, though occasionally I&amp;rsquo;ve seen ethernet addresses along the lines of p12p1 (which is a terrible naming convention that bothers the hell out of me but I understand why the linux developers switched to this naming convention).</description>

Secure Shell or SSH is a network protocol that allows data to be exchanged using a secure channel between two networked devices. Used primarily on GNU/Linux and Unix based systems to access shell accounts, SSH was designed as a replacement for Telnet and other insecure remote shells, which send information, notably passwords, in plaintext, rendering them susceptible to packet analysis.</description>
