      <h1>MySQL</h1>

<h2>Server</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Install the package.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>yum install mysql-server -y
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Set to start up auto-magically and get it going now.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>systemctl enable mysqld.service
systemctl start mysqld.service
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Run the quick and dirty secure installation script that comes with the server.
The questions are pretty straight-forward just set a secure password when it
asks for it.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>mysql_secure_installation
</pre></div>
</div>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Before applying the following configuration file in <code>/etc/my.cnf</code>. Safely
shutdown the server and delete the logfiles <code>/var/lib/mysql/ib_logfile*</code>. This
configuration file will change the size of the log buffer and it will cause an
error when starting the server backup that will look like:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>InnoDB: Error: log file ./ib_logfile0 is of a different size 0 5242880 bytes
InnoDB: than specified in the .cnf file 0 67108864 bytes!
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>There is still one major security feature that I haven&#39;t added to this
configuration yet. Running the mysql daemon in a chroot environment. Details on
setting up a chroot environment for mysql can be found, <a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/securing-mysql-step-step">here</a>, and
<a href="http://www.webhostingskills.com/articles/mysql_in_a_chrooted_environment">here</a>.</p>

<p>Detailed information on all of the configuration options can be found
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/dynamic-system-variables.html">here</a>.  There is a script that can assist in tuning larger production
databases I&#39;ve stored <a href="../mysql_tuning/">here</a>.</p>

# A user needs to have the INSERT privilege on the mysql.user table to use the

##### SSL Settings #####

# All three options are required to enable SSL for the server. To force a user
# to use an SSL connection when they are connecting to the server, while granting
# them privileges add &quot;REQUIRE SSL&quot; to the end of the grant statement. &quot;REQUIRE
# X509&quot; will require the user to present a valid certificate (it's unclear whether
# this needs to be signed by a certificate in the server's CA file), &quot;REQUIRE
# ISSUER&quot; and &quot;REQUIRE SUBJECT&quot; specify details required in the provided
# certificate. The last three imply &quot;REQUIRE SSL&quot;.

# Define the certificate authority file, it should have been used to sign the
# server's certificate, and will be used to validate client certificates that
# have been presented.
#ssl_ca = ca.crt

# The name of the SSL certficate file in PEM format to use for establishing a
# secure connection.
#ssl_cert = mysql.crt

# The name of the SSL key file in PEM format to use for establishing a secure
# connection
#ssl_key = mysql.key

##### InnoDB specific settings #####

# If there are lots of tables in the database you may need to increase this
# value from it's default of 8Mb. MySQLd will log warning messages if this is
# the case.
innodb_additional_mem_pool_size = 8M

# Amount of data to cache, default is 8Mb, shouldn't ever be more than 80% of
# server's physical memory size even on a dedicated box. Even that high may
# cause other issues on the server such as competition from the OS, and the
# space must be contiguous which isn't always available. This is only the table
# and data cache, MySQLd may allocate additional memory for buffers and control
# structures. On dedicated MySQL boxes it is recommended that this be between
# 75% and 80%
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 32M

# Validate the checksums of all pages read from disk to ensure fault tolerance
# against broken hardware or data files. Enabled by default but I like to be
# explicit...
innodb_checksums = 1

# Breaks the database into smaller more managable pieces, and if careful can
# allow for individual table backups and restoration while the server is
# running. There is a special process to handle this and it should looked up
# before attempting. The main benefit of using this option is the prevention
# of main tablespace growth.
innodb_file_per_table

# 0 = A most one second of transactions are lost in the event of an application
# crash, 1 = ACID compliant and most reliable storage of data, 2 is somewhere in
# between 0 and 1 losing at most 1 second of data only in the case of power
# outage or server failure. 1 is the default. If you're not worried about losing
# transactions for the last second or two a value of 2 can have a dramatic increase
# especially when there are a lot of short write transactions.
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 2

# An upper limit on the IO activity performed by InnoDB background tasks.
# Default value is 200 with a minimum value of 100. This parameter should be set
# approximately what the IOPS of the system disk the tables are stored on is
# able to provide (100 for 5.2k &amp; 7.2k drives, 150 for 10k, 200 for 15k and
# 250 for SSDs). It is recommended to 'keep this setting as low as practical, but
# not so low that these background activities fall behind.' Too high and data will
# be removed from the buffer pool too quickly to benefit from the caching.
innodb_io_capacity = 100

# This will prevent too much log switching on write heavy databases (default is
# 8Mb). Larger buffers all larger transactions to run without the need to write
# the log to disk before the transactions commit. On larger databases this should
# be set higher to something like 256Mb, there isn't a large benefit above 512Mb
innodb_log_file_size = 64M

# The size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk.
# Default is 8Mb. A larger log buffer allows larger transactions to run without
# a need to write the log to disk before the transactions commit.
innodb_log_buffer_size = 8M

# The size of each transaction log (default is 5Mb). The larger the value the
# less checkpoint flush activity is needed in the buffer pool saving disk IO at
# the expense of crash recovery time. Recommended is 1/nth of the
# innodb_buffer_pool_size where N is the value of innodb_log_files_in_group. In
# this file that's 1/2 of 32Mb.
innodb_log_file_size = 16M

# The number of transaction logs to make use of, the default, recommended and
# minimum is 2. These will written to in a circular fashion.
innodb_log_files_in_group = 2

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>There is some additional configuration in the systemd init script, specifically
which user/group the service will fork too (default is mysql/mysql). If you
need to change this you&#39;ll need to make the adjustment in
<code>/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mysqld.service</code>.</p>

<h3>Firewall</h3>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>-A SERVICES -m tcp -p tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT
</pre></div>
</div>

<h3>Resetting the Root Password</h3>

<p>Stop the MySQL daemon, and disable remote access to the server (block in
firewall etc). Start up MySQL with privilege checking disabled (In this mode
any credential will be accepted for any username and that user will have full
root database privileges (thus blocking remote access).</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>In a separate terminal window connect to the database:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>mysql -u root
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Refer to the section on changing a user&#39;s password at this point. When done be
sure to kill the <code>mysqld_safe</code> instance, start up the daemon normally and
restore access to the server.</p>

<h3>Quick Self Signed SSL Cert w/ Client</h3>

<p>This should be used for testing and development only, it requires a bit more
than a simple SSL cert as MySQL requires a CA cert as well so we&#39;ll generate a
self signed CA, a server certificate, and then a client certificate that can be
used for user authentication.</p>

<p>First the CA:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ca.key -nodes -days 365 \
  -out ca.crt
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Then the server cert:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -nodes -days 365 \
  -out server.csr
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -days 365 -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key \
  -set_serial 01 -out server.crt
rm server.csr
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Then the client cert:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout client.key -nodes -days 365 \
  -out client.csr
openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -days 365 -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key \
  -set_serial 02 -out client.crt
rm client.csr
</pre></div>
</div>

<h2>Client</h2>

<h3>Remotely Calculate the Size of a Database</h3>

<p>Paste the following query into an interactive console session to collect the
sizes of all databases the current user has access to:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>SELECT table_schema &quot;Database Name&quot;, SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024
  / 1024 &quot;Size in Mb&quot; FROM information_schema.TABLES GROUP BY table_schema;
</pre></div>
</div>

<h3>Drop Tables</h3>

<p>Without being able to drop a database and create a new one it can be kind of
frustrating to empty a database of all it&#39;s tables so I&#39;ve written a quick
script to drop all the tables from a specified database.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>#!/bin/bash

DBUSER=&quot;$1&quot;
DBPASS=&quot;$2&quot;
DBNAME=&quot;$3&quot;
DBHOST=&quot;$4&quot;

if [ $# -ne 4 ]; then
  echo &quot;Usage: $0 {username} {password} {database} {hostname}&quot;
  echo &quot;Drops all tables from a MySQL&quot;
  exit 1
fi

TABLES=$(mysql -u $DBUSER -p$DBPASS -h$DBHOST $DBNAME -e 'show tables;' |
  awk '{ print $1}' | grep -v '^Tables' )

for t in $TABLES; do
  echo &quot;Deleting $t table from $MDB database...&quot;
  mysql -u $DBUSER -p$DBPASS -h$DBHOST $DBNAME -e &quot;drop table $t;&quot;
done
</pre></div>
</div>

<h3>New Database and User</h3>

<p>Note: For security reasons user creation should be performed over an encrypted
channel. See the section on Using SSL.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>CREATE DATABASE example;
GRANT ALL ON example.* TO 'some-example-user'@'%.home-network.net' IDENTIFIED
  BY 'mYsUperSt0ngpassWordD0ntcoPyM3!';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</pre></div>
</div>

<h3>Change User Password</h3>

<p>Note: For security reasons this password update should be performed over an
encrypted channel. See the section on Using SSL.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>UPDATE mysql.user SET password=PASSWORD(&quot;my-new-super-secure-password&quot;) WHERE
  user='some-user-name';
</pre></div>
</div>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Quick and simple change I make to my client configuration to make the prompt a
little more verbose. Create the following file in <code>~/.my.cnf</code>:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>[mysql]prompt=(\\u@\\h) [\\d]&gt;\\_
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>This can also be set system wide in <code>/etc/my.cnf</code> for all users by appending
the above (which I do in all my server configurations).</p>

<h3>Using SSL</h3>

<p>Pretty straight forward, one off can be done like the following:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>mysql -u user -ppassword -h host --ssl-ca=./ca.crt database
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Once connected you can verify the session is encrypted with the following
query:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(root@127.0.0.1) [(none)]&gt; show status like 'ssl_cipher';
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>If the second column returned is non-empty then your session is encrypted.</p>

<h3>See Remote Version</h3>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>(user@example-mysql) [(none)]&gt; SELECT VERSION();
</pre></div>
</div>

</ul>

<h3>TCMalloc</h3>

<p>Due to high thread contention in some versions of MySQL a huge performance
boost can be gained by using a third party malloc, TCMalloc has been proven to
reduce thread contention in MySQL and provide as much as a 30% boost in all
query timing.</p>
