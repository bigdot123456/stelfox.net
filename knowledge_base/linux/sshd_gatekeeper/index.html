      <h1>Gatekeeper Script for SSH</h1>

<p>If you&#39;ve already implemented the SSH keys for authentication and have a
password on your key then you&#39;ve already achieved multi-factor authentication
to a certain degree.</p>

<p>The gatekeeper script is something that I haven&#39;t come across on any other
systems that other people administer. Perhaps it&#39;s too much trouble for them
without much gain. I had the idea for this while watching a James Bond movie.</p>

<p>A Russian systems engineer put riddles on one of his machines that you had to
go through in order to access the system, while this alone isn&#39;t secure, asking
the user random questions after authentication couldn&#39;t hurt security. I highly
recommend using some logic that changes periodically, but the client can
remotely deduce.</p>

<p>First we need to make a script to handle the additional authentication. Please
note that the following script is just an example, most of the security is in
place but you&#39;ll want to implement your own logic for the questions and
answers.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>#!/bin/sh
# gatekeeper.sh - Post-login access question script

# In the event that a user tries to get crafty and Ctrl-C out of the script
# we'll just kill the connection
trap jail INT
jail() {
  kill -9 $PPID
  exit 0
}

# Once a user logs in, check to see if they just wanted a shell.
# SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND will be null (-z) if they did
if [ -z &quot;$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND&quot; ]; then
  # The answer the user needs to know, a function or call to another script
  # could be used to generate this answer based on any number of resources
  # available to the system. This could include querying an internal web
  # script to get a daily password user's of a site have access to (and
  # perhaps are supposed to be checking)
  local CORRECT_ANSWER=&quot;muffins&quot;

  # Message displayed to the user before being prompted, I'm going to assume
  # the user knows the question in this case what's the admin's favorite
  # breakfast
  echo -n &quot;Gatekeeper token authentication required: &quot;

  # Get the user's answer. If the answer is correct execute the command.
  # If the answer is wrong, log the attempt and kill the connection.
  while read -s inputline; do
    RESPONSE=&quot;$inputline&quot;
    echo

    if [ $CORRECT_ANSWER = &quot;${RESPONSE}&quot; ]; then
      echo &quot;Gatekeeper authentication accepted.&quot;
      $SHELL -l
      exit 0
    else
      logger &quot;Gatekeeper: $USER login failed from $SSH_CLIENT&quot;
      kill -9 $PPID
      exit 0
    fi
  done
fi

# This command will bypass the gatekeeper script if the user tries to rsync as
# this script will break rsync. It creates a fresh shell just for good measure.
#if [ `echo $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND | awk '{print $1}'` = rsync ]; then
#  $SHELL -c &quot;$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND&quot;
#  exit 0
#fi

# If a user tried to execute something other than an 'approved' command just
# kill the session. This will prevent SCP and SFTP unless they are configured
# to bypass the script.
kill -9 $PPID
exit 0
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Put this script in <code>/etc/ssh/gatekeeper.sh</code> and change it&#39;s permissions to 755
with the owner being root. To make the SSH server pass off control to the
Gatekeeper script once it&#39;s done authenticating a user, we&#39;ll use the
&#39;ForceCommand&#39; command in SSHd&#39;s config file (<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>). Add the
following line to the end of the config and restart the SSH daemon.</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>ForceCommand /etc/ssh/gatekeeper.sh
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Assuming everything went according to plan, when you SSH into the remote server
once your done authenticating it&#39;ll ask for the token. Putting in &#39;muffins&#39;
should get you to your shell, while anything else will kill the connection.</p>
