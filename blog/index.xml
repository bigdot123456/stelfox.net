      <title>Better Practices With Sudo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with a lot of different linux machines from embedded devices, to cloud
servers and open stack hosts. For many of them I&amp;rsquo;m either the sole
administrator or one of three or less with administrative access. Where there
are multiple administrative users, we all are generally working as backups to
each other. We use sudo whenever we need to execute a task with privileges on
any of these machines with no direct root login permitted remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must confess I have established two habits over time that are against best
practices with regard to sudo; Using it to execute a root shell only, and not
restricting which commands can be run with sudo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sharing Context Between Dependent Rake Tasks</title>

      <description>I use Rakefiles quite a bit like traditional Makefiles, in that I specify immediate dependencies for an individual task and Rake will execute all of them. If a file or directory is the dependency and it exists, the task that creates it will be skipped. A contrieved Rakefile example might look like:
file &amp;#39;sample&amp;#39; do |t| puts &amp;#39;Creating sample directory&amp;#39; Dir.mkdir(t.name) end file &amp;#39;sample/population.txt&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; [&amp;#39;sample&amp;#39;] do |t| puts &amp;#39;Creating sample population file.</description>

      <description>I like getting unopionated feedback on the quality of the code I write. Sometimes I can get this from other developers but they tend to get annoyed being asked after every commit whether they consider it an approvement.
There are a few utilities for Ruby codebases such as flay, flog, and rubocop as well as hosted services such as Code Climate that can help you identify chunks of code that can use some work.</description>

      <description>Every now and then I find myself wanting to create a new empty branch in an existing repository. It&amp;rsquo;s useful for things such as Github Pages so you&amp;rsquo;re able to keep your content source in the master branch while only keeping the output in the gh-pages branch. I&amp;rsquo;ve also used it for testing a complete rewrite of a code base without the overhead of creating a new repo and copying access permissions.</description>

      <description>I need to filter a live logstream for only relevant events and quickly hit an issue that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting. The grep in my pipe chain was waiting until it received all the output from the prior command before it began to attempt to filter it.
Reading through the grep man page I came across the --line-buffered flag which provides exactly what I needed. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using the tail command but it serves really well in this situation to demonstrate the use:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to do a more detailed post on emailing from Amazon&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure soon, but in the meantime I wanted to quickly throw out solutions too a couple of problems I encountered. These are all specific too Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Route 53, and most are user error (myself).

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with my Nexus 5 lately. It was quickly rooted and I began playing with various ROMs that had been pre-built for the Nexus 5. My first stop was the CyanogenMod. Since I&amp;rsquo;d last used CyanogenMod they added a built-in framework that provides transparent text message encryption called WhisperPush.
WhisperPush is an implementation of Moxie Marlinspike&amp;rsquo;s highly respected TextSecure and I was very excited at the possibility of using it.</description>

      <title>Using OpenWRT&#39;s Dnsmasq as a TFTP Server</title>

      <description>I recently reflashed my primary router to a newer version of OpenWRT and attempted to follow my own directions written in an earlier blog post to add PXE booting to my local network using the dnsmasq service built in. After following my advice I found that the dnsmasq service wasn&amp;rsquo;t starting.
Looking into the logread output I finally saw that this was due too a permission issue. Combining this with the output of ps too identify the user that dnsmasq was running on I was able to both modify my instructions and use OpenWRT&amp;rsquo;s own config system to perform the configuration instead of modifying the dnsmasq configuration.</description>

      <description>I randomly started experiencing an issue with one blade in one of my PowerEdge C6100 blades. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t obey all commands issued too it via IPMI or through the BMC&amp;rsquo;s web interface. Additionally the blade would randomly power on when off, and the front light would consistently blink as if a hardware fault was detected.
This has been bothering me for a while, but it was my spare blade and wasn&amp;rsquo;t affecting my lab in anyway so I&amp;rsquo;ve ignored it.</description>

      <description>The current large project I&amp;rsquo;m working on is going to be hosted on AWS and I was requested to do a cost estimate. Looking into it, it quickly became clear that reserved instances could potentially save quite a bit of cash but there was a catch (isn&amp;rsquo;t there alway).
There is an upfront cost for reserving the instance and in exchange you get a reduced hourly rate. After running the numbers one thing wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear too me, is the upfront cost credit towards running machines or a fee you never see again?</description>

      <title>Modifying the Hosts File in a Docker Container</title>

      <description>Before I describe the issue that I encountered, let me be very clear. This hack is potentially dangerous and should absolutely only be done in development environments. This won&amp;rsquo;t affect your host system, only the docker container so the most damage you&amp;rsquo;ll do is prevent hostname and possibly user/group lookups within the container itself.
Alright with that out of the way, I was actively working on a codebase that uses subdomains as part of the identifier.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with building a pure javascript full text search engine for static content sites like this one. One of the challenges with doing this has been working around the Markdown markup embedded in the written content.
Most of the markdown syntax can be stripped out simply by removing all non-alphanumeric characters from the document and move on. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve one of the bigger challenges I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced&amp;hellip; code blocks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s hstore extension in a Rails application lately and kept encountering the error that is this post&amp;rsquo;s namesake. It would specifically happen when a database had been dropped, recreated and I freshly ran the migrations.
It seems that while Rails 4 supports the HStore datatype, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t enable the extension itself. I&amp;rsquo;ve found two ways too solve this issue in wildly different ways.
First Solution: Enable HStore by Default This is the common solution that is recommended too solve this issue.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found several places where I needed to be able to update my kernels but for one reason or another can&amp;rsquo;t update the kernel that gets booted initially. A couple of these situations were:
 Running Custom or Updated Kernels on DigitalOcean (this is one of their biggest failings IMHO) Allowing updating of kernels on embedded linux devices that require their kernel flashed into NVRAM. Running an embedded system that used an active/backup partition scheme for updating.</description>

      <description>I regularily find myself working on projects that involve the manipulation and storage of RSA keys. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve never had to worry about identification or presentation of these keys. Normally I&amp;rsquo;ve only got one too three pairs at most that I&amp;rsquo;m manipulating (server, certificate authority, client).
I&amp;rsquo;ve not found myself working on a project that involves presenting the certificates to users for selection and comparison. The obvious way too do this is take a page out of other developer&amp;rsquo;s books and present the key&amp;rsquo;s fingerprint.</description>

After the update, when that expiration came I started receiving errors in my shell that looked similar to the following (Since I fixed it I am not able to get the exact working again):</description>

      <description>Anyone that has used SSH, Tmux or Screen for a while will have inevitably dumped excessive output to their terminal. Depending on the size of the output you may have experienced the dreaded lockup. That horrible realization seconds after you hit the command where signals just stop working and you just have to sit there and wait for your terminal to catch up.
There is a piece of remote connection software called Mosh that I&amp;rsquo;ve been told handles this pretty well, but I don&amp;rsquo;t yet trust its security model and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent the same thing from happening locally.</description>

      <description>While working through a problem I found it would be immensely useful to be able to enumerate all of the current subclasses of a particular class. After thinking about this for a while I settled on a good old friend of mine, ObjectSpace.
For those not familiar with the ObjectSpace module, it is a means to inspect and access the items being tracked by Ruby&amp;rsquo;s garbage collector. This means it has a hook into every living object, and more dangerously, every near-death object.</description>

      <description>I needed to generate crypt-style SHA512 passwords in ruby for an /etc/shadow file. After a bunch of Googling and messing around with the OpenSSL library I finally found a very simple built-in way to handle this.
require &amp;#39;securerandom&amp;#39; &amp;#39;password&amp;#39;.crypt(&amp;#39;$6$&amp;#39; + SecureRandom.random_number(36 ** 8).to_s(36)) You&amp;rsquo;ll get a string that looks like:
$6$4dksjo1b$Lt194Dwy7r/7WbM8MezYZysmGcxjaiisgTrTBbHkyBZFXeqQTG0J5hep4wLM/AmYxlGNLRy0OWATLDZCqjwCk.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use the SecureRandom module you can replace the random call with simply rand(36 ** 8) though this isn&amp;rsquo;t recommended.</description>

      <description>I change the timezone on the linux systems so rarely that I almost always have to look it up. I&amp;rsquo;m writing it up here for my own personal reference. With any luck it&amp;rsquo;ll also help others.
The system timezone is controlled by the /etc/localtime file and is generally symlinked to locale files stored in /usr/share/zoneinfo. Generally I like to keep my systems on UTC as I my machines are in several timezones and it makes all the logs have consistent times.</description>

      <description>I just received my Dell PowerEdge C6100 and found it&amp;rsquo;s software quite a bit outdated. After searching around quite a bit I found the resources lacking for explaining how to perform these updates. So in this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to quickly cover updating the BMC firmware on each blade.
The system I received had four different versions of the BMC software installed, additionally Two were branded as MegaRAC and the others branded as Dell.</description>

      <description>The BIOS was quite a bit more complicated and there was a few options that I had available to try, all of which require either Windows or DOS environments. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any legal copies of Windows to put on my server and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go through all that effort`
It really needs to be done within a DOS environment. I downloaded the file PEC6100BIOS017000.exe from Dell&amp;rsquo;s support website (locally hosted copy) as well as the 2.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve come across this blog post with the intention of setting up TFTP on an modern version of OpenWRT I have a more recent blog post detailing how too configure your system.
I found myself in need of a TFTP server but wanted to avoid having all of the xinet.d packages and services on my system (even if they were disabled). While looking for alternatives I found out that dnsmasq has a built-in read-only TFTP server.</description>

      <description>I needed to support PXE booting on my home network. I use OpenWRT as my main router and DHCP server and it took me a bit of searching how to configure the BOOTP next server to redirect local clients to my Arch TFTP/NFS server for booting, so I&amp;rsquo;m placing the config here to help others who might be looking to do the same thing.
It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that this isn&amp;rsquo;t a guide on setting up PXE booting completely on an OpenWRT, you&amp;rsquo;ll need another system that is running a configured TFTP server.</description>

This was part of a larger project where I was doing statistical analysis on my email while evaluating various data stores. To get the emails into the various data stores, I used the ruby script to parse, process and store the emails as they came in.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a pure javascript based search engine for this static website and needed to access a get parameter within the URL.
I found a few solutions online but they usually made use of jQuery or weren&amp;rsquo;t in coffeescript. A few others would only extract an individual named parameter at a time. The following will return all of them in Javascript&amp;rsquo;s equilvalent of a hash (or dictionary if you prefer) in the form of an object.</description>

      <description>I recently posted a guide on backing up your Gmail with fetchmail. This unfortunately doesn&amp;rsquo;t include your calendar data. It seems like backing up was a hot enough topic that the Google Gmail team are releasing an official backup method. It&amp;rsquo;s not completely in the wild yet but I definitely look forward to poking around in it.
Now if only Google let you download everything they know about you as well&amp;hellip; Would definitely make for an interesting read.</description>

      <description>During my daily review of various new sources I came across one particular article that was both concerning and very amusing. Drones have been getting more and more popular, and more accessible. They&amp;rsquo;ve been getting used by the military, law enforcement, recently Amazon (though they&amp;rsquo;ve abandoned that for now), you can even purchase one for your iPhone at airports.
The security of these systems hasn&amp;rsquo;t been thoroughly tested publicly, though there is at least one report of a military drone being stolen already.</description>

      <description>I found myself writing another bash script that should exit should any of the few commands within it fail to run. As I began writing some error handling after each command, and isolating the sections into bash functions I figured there had to be a better way. After a little Googling and a trip through the bash manpages sure enough:
#!/bin/bash  function error_handler() { echo &amp;#34;Error occurred in script at line: ${1}.</description>

      <description>There are all kinds of password managers out there. Everything from web services that are quite solid and respectible, to native desktop apps.
A lot of these are simply too heavy for me, involve installing software on a computer to access in addition to sharing the file around, or required you to remember multiple account details before you could get access to any individual password.
Due too the various complexities and lack of matching use cases a couple years ago I set out to develop my own open-source version of Passpack.</description>

      <description>This morning I found myself in need of a large set of emails to test a particular set of code. Ideally these emails would be broken out into easily digestable pieces, and it was strictly for my own personal testing so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t concerned with using my own live data for this test (There will probably be another post on this project later on).
Having used fetchmail with good results in the past I decided it was a good idea to take this opportunity to also backup my Gmail account into the common Maildir format (which essentially breaks out emails into individual files meeting my requirements).</description>

      <description>Recently while writing a Ruby program I needed to parse some command line options. Helpfully Ruby provides a module named OptionParser to make this easy. I found a few parts of the documentation ambiguous and a few others down right confusing.
The catch I hit was the required field. In my mind the definition of a required argument is something that needs to be passed on the commandline to continue. What OptionParser actually means is that a value isn&amp;rsquo;t required when the argument is passed.</description>

      <description>I recently went back through my backups recently and found quite a few old abandoned projects. Looking back on the code I see some things I&amp;rsquo;m impressed with, but the majority of the code I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t write today. Thats not to say the code is bad, or doesn&amp;rsquo;t function. It did exactly what I wanted to accomplish at the time, just not necessarily in the most efficient way.
This archive of old code made me start wondering how much old code I&amp;rsquo;m using in the projects that I&amp;rsquo;m currently writing.</description>

      <description>A good friend of mine recently left the organization I work for and the task of resetting our passwords and auditing credentials fell on me. Since we use Heroku for our development platform I needed to not only reset the credentials for the web portion (which conveniently also handles resetting the API key) but also revoke any SSH keys he may have added to access it.
Sadly Heroku does not seem to provide any web interface that I could find for examining what keys were associated with the account.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a real quick post. I&amp;rsquo;m using the &amp;ldquo;carrier_wave&amp;rdquo; gem with &amp;ldquo;fog&amp;rdquo; for one of my projects and found that when a file is stored on S3 the &amp;ldquo;identifier&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;filename&amp;rdquo; methods return nil. I got around this issue in two separate ways neither of which I&amp;rsquo;m particularly happy about.
Outside of the uploader, you can use the File utility and the URL of the object to get the base filename like so:</description>

      <description>Jeremy Spilman recently proposed changes to how user&amp;rsquo;s hashes are stored in website&amp;rsquo;s and companies databases. This post was originally going to look at some of the issues involved in the scheme he envisioned, however, he rather quickly posted a followup article with a well thought out solution that countered all of the issues that other people and myself were able to come up with. I&amp;rsquo;d strongly recommend reading both if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so.</description>

      <description>So I recently encountered a situation where I needed to define a prefix on the tables used by the &amp;ldquo;data_mapper&amp;rdquo; gem. When I went searching I found quite a bit of information about similar projects in Python, and PHP named DataMapper but nothing about the ruby &amp;ldquo;data_mapper&amp;rdquo;. The search continued eventually ending in my reading through the source of the data_mapper gem only to find that there was no feature for simply defining a prefix.</description>

This is something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do for some time and have been mulling over in the back of my mind. I&amp;rsquo;ll go over the details from start to finish of setting up hurricane electric on the router in another post as the information to do so is very scattered and disjointed.</description>

      <description>For the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a Ruby project that needed to interact with a remote XMLRPC API. This isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly unusual but it was the first time from within a Ruby application. Luckily enough Ruby has a built in XMLRPC client that handles a lot of the messy bits.
The XMLRPC::Client class itself seems fairly simple. There are only a handful of methods, five of which are for opening a new connection in a few different ways, and at least two ways to open each type of connection.</description>

      <description>So I found a dirt cheap video SIP phone (ACN Iris 3000) at a local HAM fest. After looking around I found the vendor has locked in the phone with their specific service with an iron grip and had gone out of business. I guess I should expect that kind of anti-competitive behavior from a business that Donald Trump has a vested interest in.
I&amp;rsquo;ve come across one post on a forum that seems to have been crawled and copied out every where.</description>

      <description>One of the hot-topics for IPv6 (which I have been thinking about a lot lately) is NAT. I normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go into detail about specifics that are obvious to people in my field but for the sake of this post I will. NAT or Network Address Translation, is a way for a large number of computers to share a single public IP address.
The router that is handling the NAT will keep track of connections coming in and out of it and re-write the destination IP to an internal address to keep the traffic flowing.</description>

I let my crawler go and stopped it after a 24 hour period. I ran ls on the directory the images were being saved in to see the results and my ssh session locked up&amp;hellip; Or so I thought. I hit Ctrl-C and nothing happened&amp;hellip; So I closed my window and opened a new one.</description>
