      <title>Investigating LVM From Dracut</title>

      <description>In my my last post, I covered finding logical volumes that were missing from LVM from within a live CD (which is effectively a whole standard environment). Working with dracut is quite a bit more limited.
Turns out that the commands I&amp;rsquo;m normally used to for operating and inspecting LVM volumes can all be accessed as a second parameter to the lvm tool like so:
$ lvm vgscan $ lvm pvscan $ lvm lvscan For my particular issue, it led me to notice that block device of my root filesystem was missing due to a missing kernel driver&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Visible Yet Missing Logical Volumes</title>

      <description>While working on an automated install script for an embedded board, I hit an issue with the logical volumes never showing up in /dev/mapper, and in turn unable to be mounted. This left me in the dracut emergency shell (after about three minutes), with little to go on beyond the following error:
[187.508531] dracut Warning: Could not boot. [187.510560] dracut Warning: /dev/disk/by-uuid/5681-902D does not exist [187.512534] dracut Warning: /dev/mapper/system-root does not exit [187.</description>

      <title>Vultr Deny All Firewall</title>

      <description>While setting up new instances on Vultr for testing, I wanted to initially ensure that no traffic beyond my own could touch the instances. After adding a matching rule for SSH to my IPv4 address, a default rule shows up that drops any unspecified traffic. Switching to the IPv6 I wanted to add a drop all rule (as I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be using IPv6 until the system was up).
The interface only allows accept rules to be created and additionally you&amp;rsquo;ll be greeted with this message while trying to figure out what to do:</description>

      <title>Security Principles</title>

      <description>While reviewing current security hardening practices put out by several organizations and attempting to filter the good recommendations from the outdated legislated requirements, I came across one of the best descriptions of basic security principles. You can find it in the NIST Guide to General Server Security (published in 2008).
I&amp;rsquo;ve replicated section 2.4 from the linked document (I have removed the footnotes, but it is otherwise unchanged) in its entirety here for safe keeping and to hopefully help expose this to more people.</description>

      <title>Linux Audit Rule Paths</title>

      <description>I encountered a little bit of confusion while rewriting my auditd rules which some Googling did not help me solve.
When monitoring a file or directory there are two forms the rules can take. They are effectively equivalent in their functionality. The simpler form is the following format:
-w /etc/shadow -p wa -w /boot -p wa -w /etc/dont_readme -p r  These three rules are all behaving slightly differently. The first will audit any writes or attribute changes to the shadow file.</description>

      <title>Vulnerable Smart Cards</title>

      <description>In addition to the WiFi vulnerability a much more limited vulnerability was announced around private GPG keys that were generated using Infineon&amp;rsquo;s RSA Library version v1.02.013.
The vulnerability lies in shortcuts taken to speed up the key generation using the library. The performance increase makes the private key vulnerable to factorization attacks using an extension to Coppersmith&amp;rsquo;s attack.
It has been confirmed that YubiKey 4s are effected as are many nations national ID cards.</description>

      <description>An advisory from US CERT has been circulating for the last week about a protocol level flaw in WPA &amp;amp; WPA2. The advisory itself was:
 US-CERT has become aware of several key management vulnerabilities in the 4-way handshake of the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) security protocol. The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes decryption, packet replay, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, and others. Note that as protocol-level issues, most or all correct implementations of the standard will be affected.</description>

      <title>The Case of an Empty Executable</title>

      <description>I recently came across a short article written about a decade ago. It was a curious thing already as it was hosted in a user&amp;rsquo;s home directory off a web server with the standard &amp;lsquo;~&amp;rsquo; showing up in the URL. The important part that caught my eye was this:
 The &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit status. This can be done with an empty file that&amp;rsquo;s marked executable, and that&amp;rsquo;s what it was in the earliest unix system libraries.</description>

      <description>This is an interesting proof of work concept. The first example I have found of this in the wild is to prevent abuse for anonymous account registration on an IRC network.
I reviewed it&amp;rsquo;s source and found that it requests a seed, and payload from a backend PHP script. It assumes that a target collision will happen within 1,000,000 iterations.
This is broken up into 10 iterations. A pool of four WebWorkers are spawned.</description>

      <title>Better Practices With Sudo</title>
      <link>https://stelfox.net/blog/2016/02/better-practices-with-sudo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with a lot of different linux machines from embedded devices, to cloud
servers and open stack hosts. For many of them I&amp;rsquo;m either the sole
administrator or one of three or less with administrative access. Where there
are multiple administrative users, we all are generally working as backups to
each other. We use sudo whenever we need to execute a task with privileges on
any of these machines with no direct root login permitted remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must confess I have established two habits over time that are against best
practices with regard to sudo; Using it to execute a root shell only, and not
restricting which commands can be run with sudo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
