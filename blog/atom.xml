      <title>The Case of an Empty Executable</title>

      <description>I recently came across a short article written about a decade ago. It was a curious thing already as it was hosted in a user&amp;rsquo;s home directory off a webserver with the standard &amp;lsquo;~&amp;rsquo; showing up in the URL. The important part that caught my eye was this:
 The &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit status. This can be done with an empty file that&amp;rsquo;s marked executable, and that&amp;rsquo;s what it was in the earliest unix system libraries.</description>

      <title>Better Practices With Sudo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work with a lot of different linux machines from embedded devices, to cloud
servers and open stack hosts. For many of them I&amp;rsquo;m either the sole
administrator or one of three or less with administrative access. Where there
are multiple administrative users, we all are generally working as backups to
each other. We use sudo whenever we need to execute a task with privileges on
any of these machines with no direct root login permitted remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must confess I have established two habits over time that are against best
practices with regard to sudo; Using it to execute a root shell only, and not
restricting which commands can be run with sudo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sharing Context Between Dependent Rake Tasks</title>

      <description>I use Rakefiles quite a bit like traditional Makefiles, in that I specify immediate dependencies for an individual task and Rake will execute all of them. If a file or directory is the dependency and it exists, the task that creates it will be skipped. A contrieved Rakefile example might look like:
file &amp;#39;sample&amp;#39; do |t| puts &amp;#39;Creating sample directory&amp;#39; Dir.mkdir(t.name) end file &amp;#39;sample/population.txt&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; [&amp;#39;sample&amp;#39;] do |t| puts &amp;#39;Creating sample population file.</description>

      <title>Ruby Code Quality Metrics</title>

      <description>I like getting unopionated feedback on the quality of the code I write. Sometimes I can get this from other developers but they tend to get annoyed being asked after every commit whether they consider it an approvement.
There are a few utilities for Ruby codebases such as flay, flog, and rubocop as well as hosted services such as Code Climate that can help you identify chunks of code that can use some work.</description>

      <title>Creating an Empty Git Branch</title>

      <description>Every now and then I find myself wanting to create a new empty branch in an existing repository. It&amp;rsquo;s useful for things such as Github Pages so you&amp;rsquo;re able to keep your content source in the master branch while only keeping the output in the gh-pages branch. I&amp;rsquo;ve also used it for testing a complete rewrite of a code base without the overhead of creating a new repo and copying access permissions.</description>

      <description>I need to filter a live logstream for only relevant events and quickly hit an issue that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting. The grep in my pipe chain was waiting until it received all the output from the prior command before it began to attempt to filter it.
Reading through the grep man page I came across the --line-buffered flag which provides exactly what I needed. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using the tail command but it serves really well in this situation to demonstrate the use:</description>

      <description>While running an aide check on one of my servers after updating it, I started seeing a large number of very concerning warning messages:
/usr/sbin/prelink: /bin/mailx: at least one of file&#39;s dependencies has changed since prelinking Error on exit of prelink child process /usr/sbin/prelink: /bin/rpm: at least one of file&#39;s dependencies has changed since prelinking Error on exit of prelink child process /usr/sbin/prelink: /sbin/readahead: at least one of file&#39;s dependencies has changed since prelinking Error on exit of prelink child process /usr/sbin/prelink: /lib64/libkrb5.</description>

      <description>I needed too turn some hexidecimal values into decimal in a bash script and found a real easy way too do it. The following is a very short bash script demostrating how too turn the hexidecimal string &amp;ldquo;deadbeefcafe&amp;rdquo; into it&amp;rsquo;s equivalent decimal value of &amp;ldquo;244837814094590&amp;rdquo;.
#!/bin/bash  INPUT=&amp;#34;deadbeefcafe&amp;#34; OUTPUT=$((0x${INPUT})) echo $OUTPUT</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to do a more detailed post on emailing from Amazon&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure soon, but in the meantime I wanted to quickly throw out solutions too a couple of problems I encountered. These are all specific too Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Route 53, and most are user error (myself).
SPF Invalid Characters or Format After generating my SPF record, I jumped into Route 53, created a new record pasted in my record, attempted to save and received the following message:</description>

      <title>Unregistering From WhisperPush After Flashing a New ROM</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with my Nexus 5 lately. It was quickly rooted and I began playing with various ROMs that had been pre-built for the Nexus 5. My first stop was the CyanogenMod. Since I&amp;rsquo;d last used CyanogenMod they added a built-in framework that provides transparent text message encryption called WhisperPush.
WhisperPush is an implementation of Moxie Marlinspike&amp;rsquo;s highly respected TextSecure and I was very excited at the possibility of using it.</description>
